## Technical Implementation Strategy

### Database First Approach
1. **Schema Implementation**: Start with complete database schema
2. **RLS Policies**: Implement security policies early
3. **API Layer**: Use Supabase auto-generated APIs
4. **Real-time**: Implement subscriptions for live updates

### Component-Driven Development
1. **UI Components**: Build reusable component library
2. **Feature Components**: Create feature-specific components
3. **Page Components**: Compose pages from feature components
4. **Testing**: Unit test components in isolation

### State Management Strategy
1. **Server State**: Use Supabase client for server state
2. **Client State**: Use Zustand for application state
3. **Form State**: Use React Hook Form for form management
4. **Cache Management**: Implement optimistic updates

## Quality Assurance

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Component and utility function testing
- **Integration Tests**: API and database integration testing
- **E2E Tests**: Critical user workflow testing
- **Performance Tests**: Load time and responsiveness testing

### Code Quality

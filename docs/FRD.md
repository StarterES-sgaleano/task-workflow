# Solo Developer To-Do App - Functional Design Document (Cloud Edition)

## 1. Project Overview

### Vision Statement

Create a commit-oriented task management application specifically designed for solo full-stack developers, delivered as a cloud-based desktop application with real-time collaboration capabilities, seamless synchronization, and enterprise-grade security through Supabase integration.

### Core Problems Solved

- **Flow Interruption**: Current tools require too many clicks/forms to capture quick tasks
- **Context Switching**: Tasks and documentation exist in separate silos
- **Workflow Mismatch**: PM tools don't align with developer commit-based thinking
- **Overhead**: Enterprise tools are too heavy for solo developers
- **Data Isolation**: Need secure, cloud-based storage with proper user separation
- **Synchronization**: Work across multiple devices without losing data

### Target User

Solo full-stack developers who work on multiple projects and need to:

- Quickly capture tasks without breaking coding flow
- Link tasks to documentation and vice versa
- Track work that leads to commits
- Maintain project context across sessions and devices
- Access their work from anywhere with proper security
- Collaborate with future team members (infrastructure ready)

profiles (
  id uuid references auth.users primary key,
  username text unique,
  full_name text,
  avatar_url text,
  preferences jsonb default '{}',
  created_at timestamptz default now(),
  updated_at timestamptz default now()
)

-- Projects for organizing work
projects (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id uuid references auth.users not null,
  name text not null,
  description text,
  color text default '#3b82f6',
  is_archived boolean default false,
  created_at timestamptz default now(),
  updated_at timestamptz default now()
)

-- Unified items table for tasks and documents
items (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id uuid references auth.users not null,
  project_id uuid references projects,
  type item_type not null, -- enum: 'task', 'document'
  title text not null check (char_length(title) <= 200),
  content text default '',
  status task_status, -- enum: 'todo', 'in_progress', 'done' (null for documents)
  metadata jsonb default '{}',
  created_at timestamptz default now(),
  updated_at timestamptz default now()
)

-- Mention relationships between items
mentions (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id uuid references auth.users not null,
  source_item_id uuid references items on delete cascade,
  target_item_id uuid references items on delete cascade,
  mention_text text not null,
  created_at timestamptz default now()
)
